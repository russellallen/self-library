**Abstract:**

All organizational functions carried out by classes can be
accomplished in a simple and natural way by object inheritance in
classless languages, with no need for special mechanisms. A single
model--dividing types into prototypes and traits--supports sharing of
behavior and extending or replacing representations. A natural
extension, dynamic object inheritance, can model behavioral
modes. Object inheritance can also be used to provide structured name
spaces for well-known objects.  Classless languages can even express
'class-based' encapsulation. These stylized uses of object
inheritance become instantly recognizable idioms, and extend the
repertory of organizing principles to cover a wider range of programs.
