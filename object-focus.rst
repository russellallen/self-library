Getting Close to Objects: Object-Focused Programming Environments

**Abstract:**

Current visual programming environments make use of 
views and tools to present objects. These view-focused 
environments provide great functionality at the expense of 
distancing the objects behind the intermediary layers of 
views and tools. We propose the object-focused model, 
which attempts to foster the notion that objects themselves 
are directly available for interaction. Unique, directly 
manipulable representations of objects make them 
immediate, and basing functionality on the object rather 
than on extrinsic tools makes them the primary loci of 
action. But although immediacy and primacy contribute to 
the sense of concreteness of the objects, discarding 
conventional views and tools potentially restrict the 
functionality of the environment. Fortunately, by being 
extremely faithful to the notion of concreteness of objects, 
two principles emerge that allow object-focused 
environments to match the functionality of view-focused 
environments. The principle of availability makes 
functionality of objects accessible across contexts, and the 
principle of liveliness allows objects to participate in 
multiple contexts while retaining concreteness. All these 
elements help make objects seem more real in the object-
focused environment, hopefully lessening some of the 
cognitive burden of programming by reducing the distance 
between the programmer's mental model of objects and the 
environment's representation of objects. Programmers can 
get the sense that the objects on the screen are the objects in 
the program, and thus can think about working with objects 
rather than manipulating the environment.
