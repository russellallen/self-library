**Abstract:**

Manipulating programs is hard, while manipulating objects in 
the physical world is often easy. Several attributes of the 
physical world make it comprehensible and manipulable: concreteness, 
uniformity, and flexibility. The Self programming system attempts to 
apply these attributes to the world within the computer. The semantics 
of the language, the efficiency and fidelity of its implementation, 
and the architecture of its user interface conspire to make the 
experience of constructing programs in Self immediate and tangible. 
We describe the mechanisms used to achieve this goal, and illustrate 
those mechanisms within the context of an extended programming task.
