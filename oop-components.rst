Integrating Independently-Developed Components in Object-Oriented Languages

**Abstract:**

Object-oriented programming promises to increase programmer 
productivity through better reuse of existing code. However, reuse is not yet 
pervasive in today's object-oriented programs. Why is this so? We argue that 
one reason is that current programming languages and environments assume 
that components are perfectly coordinated. Yet in a world where programs 
are mostly composed out of reusable components, these components are not 
likely to be completely integrated because the sheer number of components 
would make global coordination impractical. Given that seemingly minor in
consistencies between individually designed components would exist, we ex
amine how they can lead to integration problems with current programming 
language mechanisms. We discuss several reuse mechanisms that can adapt 
a component in place without requiring access to the component's source 
code and without needing to re-typecheck it.
