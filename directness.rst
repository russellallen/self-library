Directness and Liveness in the Morphic User Interface Construction Environment
==============================================================================

John H. Maloney and Randall B. Smith

**Abstract:**

Morphic is a user interface construction environment strives to embody directness and liveness. Directness means a user interface designer can initiate the process of examining or changing the attributes, structure, and behavior of user interface components by pointing at their graphical representations directly. Liveness means the user interface is always active and reactive - objects respond to user actions, animations run, layout happens, and information displays update continuously. Four implementation techniques work together to support animation, and multiple users working simultaneously in a
directness and liveness in Morphic: structural reification, layout reification, ubiquitous animation, and live editing.
